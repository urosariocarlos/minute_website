It is very very easy to create a nice static website using RStudio.

This document will take you through how to create your own static website and publish it on Github. You can use this website as a template to develop your own. 

### Getting Started

1. Got to the online [Github repository](https://github.com/poldham/minute_website). Choose `Fork` to create your own copy in your Github account and then choose the large green `Clone` button to download into Github Desktop. 

2. In Github desktop look for the file called `minute_website.Rproj` with the blue R icon. Open it in RStudio.

3. Press `Build` to build this website.

4. Go to `Next Steps` in the menu.
